• What is the best way for you to present your content?
• Will your design be [responsive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)?
3. Make a wireframe.
4. Save an image of the wireframe in your local directory.
5. Take a moment to blog below why wire framing is important to you. Put your own spin on your explanation.
6. Commit your changes with a brief and meaningful message.
7. Push up the changes to **your forked version of the repository.**
